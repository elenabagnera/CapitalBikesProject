# CapitalBikesProject

This is for a group project for POL706 at Georgetown University

## Tasks 

1. Create visualizations on the current data in `visualizations.Rmd`. 

This could graph weather verses departures, temperature vs departues, heat maps, and the other examples in `visualizations.Rmd`.

~~2. Widen hour_data on the column type for each station.~~

3. Clean up weather predictors.

Delete columns that have missing data or find out how to fill in that data. Some data is likely not needed (wind_direction for example)

4. Create models on the new data

5. Analyze results of models

6. Create final website to present results
