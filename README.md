# CapitalBikesProject

This is for a group project for POL706 at Georgetown University

## Tasks 

1. Create visualizations on the current data in visualizations.Rmd. 

This could graph weather verses departures, temperature vs departues, heat maps, and the other examples in visualizations.Rmd.

1. Widen hour_data on the column type for each station. 

This should produce two new columns to replace the column for each station. For example `23rd_&_e_st_nw` should become `23rd_&_e_st_nw_dep` and `23rd_&_e_st_nw_arr` based on the `type` field. The other columns are all the same value for both rows (departure and arrival row for each station) and should be unchanged.

This will require a minor update for ridership when complete.

1. Create models on the new data

1. Analyze results of models

1. Create final website to present results
